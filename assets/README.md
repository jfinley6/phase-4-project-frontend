User Story

Blog
As a user I should be able to view content upon screen load, but not able to interact.
If I want to interact, I have to sign up.
I can create posts.
I can view blog posts, like, save, and comment on posts. 
I can view the posts that I have made, and what I have saved on my user profile.
I can go back to the homepage and view new posts.
